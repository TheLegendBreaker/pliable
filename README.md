## as in making the DOM pliable.

The idea is to use JavaScript to create an in browser page editor that allows meto manipulate pages in the browser rather than in a text editor. A simplified WIZIWIG editor. The major difference is there are no pre defined blocks or elements, and there fore, no need to point, click, and drag to make changes. Rather selecting an element on the page opens a form with the element's inner html presented.

The no sign in website will simply give users a string of all the custom mark up, style rules, and scripts they entered.

The sign in version will presists a user's data by using PHP to create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The UI will provide a way for them to down load their designs as file, piecemeal, or copy a string of the written code to the clipboard.

HI need to fix the CSS so that when a user selects an image on a thread or post, the screen contains the selected image.

Then I need to develop the banner carousel functionality. The banners that the user uploads need to be visible on the catalog and list views as a rotating image carousel. In the catalog view, the carousel will have the dimensions of the posts. In the list view, the carousel will appear as a banner that takes up the width of all the board's threads and will be placed under the board title and above the board's threads.

Let me know if this is a good summary of task 7. It's a complex task. I want to make sure I understand your intentions so I don't waste time doing something that isn't in your vision.

With those two tasks done, I need to set up a dark and light theme functionality that users can toggle with a switch. I could then optimize each theme for maximum style, readability, and useability.

The lowest priority items have to do with the thread hiding/showing UI. I need to implement and blend the two options provided. To my mind, that means that when a user hides a thread, hidden the thread section. Hidden threads are moved to a hidden-thread section that users can open to view and un-hide hidden threads. This hidden-thread section sits either on top or below the active-threads section. Users hide threads by tapping on a '-' or hide button. 
Then each post needs to have a set of actions buttons available for users to share, hide, filter, and moderate.

Are post the same as threads? I assumed so, but I still want to confirm my assumption.

Apologies for the long message. I want to ensure I understand the tasks and work toward your vision. No worries if you can't answer my questions right away. I will work around each spot I need clarification. 

Thanks for your time. Let me know if you have any questions.

Oh, and one more thing. I wanted to implement branches for the version control. When I start a task, I want to branch the project. That way, you can approve the changes to the project before they are committed to the main Git branch. Let me know if this is acceptable.
